## Tracking the emergence of computer science topics in papers, grants, and patents

Ideas flow between universities, industry, and funding agencies through word of mouth, seminars, conferences, publications, new software, new funding, and the media. What is the temporal relationship between these entities? How long does it take for an idea that is popular in scientific research (as seen through mentions in scientific papers) to find technological applications (as seen through mentions in patents)?

In this paper, we select ten emerging trends in computer science as case studies (deep neural networks, long short term memory networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, knowledge graphs, word embeddings, cloud computing, the internet of things, blockchain, and crowdsourcing) and track their frequency in datasets of research paper abstracts, patents, and grants. We calculate the lag between each dataset, finding that for seven of ten trends, patents lag behind papers (median=1.9 years), while for nine of ten trends, grants lag behind papers (median=2.5 years). We also observe that some trends take more than a decade to become popular after they first appear in research papers, and speculate that in these cases, it was necessary to wait for technology to catch up before the idea could be fully developed.
